Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek.

Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

The dates are those “on which cherry blossom viewing parties had been held or full flowerings had been observed.” Over the past century, Kyoto’s cherry trees have been blooming earlier and earlier.

2017.07.19,2,Dublin in detail.,"Last week, a team at NYU announced “the world’s densest urban aerial laser scanning (LiDAR) dataset” — a 1.4-billion-point description of Dublin’s city center. They write: ”At over 300 points per square meter, this is more than 30 times denser than typical LiDAR data and is an order of magnitude denser than any other aerial LiDAR dataset.” The researchers collected the topographical data during a series of criss-crossing flyovers on March 26, 2015. They’ve also published a short, illustrative video. Previously: LiDAR datasets (DIP 2016.05.25) and 3D models (DIP 2017.04.05) of cities and countries around the world.

For each “lineage,” the reports provide data on the geography, timing, and number of sequenced viral samples that bear the strain’s signature. The project, led by biologists at Scripps Research, is one of many that draw from the genomic data collected by GISAID (DIP 2020.03.11), which also publishes its own variants dashboard. Related: The US CDC is tracking the number of variant cases reported in each state and territory. But they’re only providing cumulative counts, so USA Today has begun scraping (and backfilling) the data to maintain a historical record. [h/t Betsy Ladyzhets]","https://outbreak.info

Meanwhile, they and collaborators have continued updating and expanding the research; you can request access to their latest datasets.

For each expulsion, the dataset provides “information on the expelling country, onset, duration, region, scale, category of persons expelled, and frequency.” To download it, visit the Journal of Peace Research’s replication data portal and search for “mass expulsion.”","https://www.meghanmgarrity.com/

But be prepared to wait: “Our determination of the trough date in April 2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier determinations took between 4 and 21 months.” [h/t USAFacts]","https://www.nber.org/about-nber

You can filter and download these counts by age, gender, and race. Profiles of individual jails also list the most common charges and the overall demographics of people held there. The time frames available vary by jail, but mostly begin in 2020 or 2021. You can also apply for access to person-level records. [h/t Adam Vine + Orion Taylor]","https://publicsafetylab.org/

2023.05.24,2,The top of BuzzFeed News.,"You’ve likely heard: BuzzFeed Inc. has shut down BuzzFeed News, where I worked from 2014 to early 2022. In July 2018, the newsroom launched its own website, BuzzFeedNews.com, distinct from BuzzFeed.com. The top of the new homepage featured a “Trending” strip, with links to a handful of editor-selected articles. A few months later, I wrote a computer script to save the text, URL, and position of each link on the strip. My personal server ran that script every five minutes (with occasional interruptions) until the newsroom’s final day of operation on May 5. Here’s what it saw.

2023.12.06,3,EU court cases.,"The IUROPA Project’s CJEU Database “is the most complete collection of research-ready data about the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and European Union (EU) law.” Developed from several official sources by Stein Arne Brekke et al., the database provides tables of all cases (45,000+), parties (85,000+), proceedings (47,000+), decisions (50,000+), citations (1,000,000+), judges (270+), and more from the court’s inception in 1952 through 2022. That first table, for instance, lists each case’s name, ID, sub-court, year, judgment status, appeal status, and additional details. [h/t Erik Gahner Larsen]","https://www.iuropa.pol.gu.se/about

2023.12.06,4,The Fed’s “dot plots.”,"Four times a year, the US Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee publishes its “Summary of Economic Projections” reports. Those reports contain a chart that’s come to be known as the Fed’s “dot plot,” which tallies the committee members’ forecasts of the year-end federal funds interest rate for this and subsequent years. Upon noticing “no simple, easy-to-access data file” of the chart’s information, journalist Ben Welsh wrote a scraper to create such a file, currently covering 2018–present. Previously: Federal Reserve communications collected by Agam Shah et al. (DIP 2023.08.09).","https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm

2023.12.06,5,Many coin flips.,"“Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process,” write František Bartoš et al., introducing an experiment in which “a group of 48 people (i.e., all but three of the co-authors) tossed coins of 46 different currencies × denominations and obtained a total number of 350,757 coin flips.” The authors have published the raw results, images of each coin, and videos of the flips.
